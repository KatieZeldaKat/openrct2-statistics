# OpenRCT2 Statistics

A way for you to track your in-game statistics (overall and per-park) such as:

- Time you've spent in-game
- Number of rides you've built
- Number of vehicles you've crashed

...that's all you need, right?

## Future development

Okay, so there might be other statistics you would want to track in-game. Some of these have not been implemented yet. Some ideas which come to mind:

- Scenarios beaten
- Multiplayer messages sent
- Guests drowned
- ✅ Rides built
- ✅ Rides crashed

Some of these would require an update to `openrct2.d.ts` to track, though some can be implemented right now with contributions!

If you're feeling motivated, you can contribute to this project following the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
