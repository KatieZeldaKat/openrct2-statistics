# OpenRCT2 Statistics

A way for you to track your in-game statistics (overall and per-park) such as:

- Time you've spent in-game

...that's all you need, right?

## Getting the plugin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires OpenRCT2 v0.4.0 or newer.

Download the `.js` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/KatieZeldaKat/openrct2-statistics/releases/latest) and place it in the "plugin" folder. This can be found by opening OpenRCT2 and selecting "Open custom content folder" under the toolbox in the main menu.

## Future development

Okay, so there might be other statistics you would want to track in-game. These have not been implemented yet. Some ideas which come to mind:

- Scenarios beaten
- Multiplayer messages sent
- Rides built
- Rides crashed
- Guests drowned

Some of these would require an update to `openrct2.d.ts` to track, though some can be implemented right now with contributions!

If you're feeling motivated, you can contribute to this project following the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
